                                                Spidermonkey Island, many people offered their help, including Matthew

                                                finding stowaways hiding on the ship. First, he found Matthew Mugg
                                                hiding behind some flour bags, and not long after, he found Luke the
                                                Hermit and his wife hiding in the Doctor's cabin beneath his bunk.
                                                Before dropping everyone off at the nearest town, the Doctor gave Luke
                                                and his wife the last bit of money he had left so she could get some

                                                the cruel sport of bullfighting. The crew also met Don Enrique Cardenas,
                                                the man who supplied the bulls for the fights. The Doctor then made a

                                                much-needed money. She told Bumpo to make a side bet with Don Enrique
                                                that would win them three-thousand pesetas if the Doctor defeated the
                                                matador. On the day of the bullfight, the Doctor visited with the bulls
                                                and informed them that if they followed his instructions inside the
                                                bullring, he would be able to stop bullfighting. The bulls promised to
                                                listen to him and the Doctor finally made his way into the

                                                bullfighter in Monteverde. Pepito was first in the ring, and he cleverly
                                                avoided the charging bull several times. Then the Doctor entered the

                                                charged Pepito, but when the Doctor stared at the bull, it stopped and
                                                began to tremble. Things then took a surprising turn when the Doctor
                                                began chasing the bull around the ring. Once he caught the bull, he made
